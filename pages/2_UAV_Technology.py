    ## What are UAVs?
    
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are aircraft that operate without a human pilot on board. 
    They can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans.
    
    ### Types of UAVs Used in Agriculture:
    
    1. **Multirotor Drones**: Easy to maneuver but with limited flight time and coverage
       - Quadcopters (4 rotors)
       - Hexacopters (6 rotors)
       - Octocopters (8 rotors)
    
    2. **Fixed-Wing Drones**: Longer flight time and greater coverage but require takeoff and landing space
    
    3. **Hybrid VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing)**: Combine benefits of multirotors and fixed-wing drones
    
    ## UAV Applications in Sugarcane Farming
    
    UAVs equipped with various sensors can perform multiple tasks:
    
    ### Monitoring & Assessment
    - **Crop Health Monitoring**: Identify stress, disease, and pest problems
    - **Growth Tracking**: Monitor plant height, density, and development over time
    - **Yield Estimation**: Predict harvest amounts before the harvesting season
    - **Water Management**: Detect irrigation issues and water stress
    
    ### Analysis & Planning
    - **Variable Rate Application Maps**: Create prescription maps for fertilizers and pesticides
    - **Harvest Planning**: Optimize harvest timing and logistics
    - **Drainage Analysis**: Identify areas with water drainage issues

## UAV Data Collection Process

The typical workflow for using UAVs in sugarcane farming includes:

1. **Mission Planning**: Define the area to survey and flight parameters
2. **Flight Execution**: Deploy the UAV to automatically follow the planned route
3. **Data Collection**: Capture imagery and sensor data during flight
4. **Data Processing**: Convert raw data into usable information through specialized software
5. **Analysis**: Interpret the processed data to make agricultural decisions
6. **Implementation**: Apply findings to optimize farming practices

## Key Advantages for Sugarcane Farmers

- **Efficiency**: Survey large areas quickly (up to 1,000 acres per day)
- **Accessibility**: Reach areas difficult to access by ground vehicles
- **Timeliness**: Collect data when needed, regardless of field conditions
- **High Resolution**: Capture detailed information not visible to the naked eye
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduce labor costs and time for field scouting
- **Non-Invasive**: Monitor crops without physically entering and potentially damaging fields

# Regulatory considerations
with st.expander("Regulatory Considerations for Agricultural UAVs"):
    st.markdown("""
    When operating UAVs for agricultural purposes, farmers need to be aware of:
    
    1. **Registration Requirements**: Most countries require registration of UAVs above certain weight thresholds
    2. **Pilot Certification**: Commercial operations often require certified pilots
    3. **Flight Restrictions**: 
       - Maximum altitude (typically 400 feet/120 meters)
       - Visual line of sight requirements
       - No-fly zones near airports, populated areas, etc.
    4. **Insurance**: Liability coverage for potential accidents
    5. **Privacy Concerns**: Avoiding data collection over neighboring properties
    6. **Data Ownership**: Understanding who owns the collected data
    
    *Regulations vary by country and region, so always check local laws before operating UAVs for agricultural purposes.*
