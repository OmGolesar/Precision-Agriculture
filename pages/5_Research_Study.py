    1. Start with multispectral imaging for early growth monitoring and nitrogen management
    2. Consider adding LiDAR capability for mid-to-late season biomass estimation if large-scale operations justify the investment

# Conclusion section
st.markdown("""
## Study Conclusions

This research provides valuable insights into the optimal use of UAV-based remote sensing technologies for sugarcane monitoring:

1. **Technology Selection by Growth Stage:**
   - Early growth stage: Multispectral imaging provides the best results
   - Late growth stage: LiDAR technology offers superior biomass estimation

2. **Nitrogen Management:**
   - Multispectral imaging, particularly using the Red Edge band, provides reliable estimates of leaf nitrogen content
   - LiDAR technology alone is not suitable for nitrogen assessment

3. **Cost-Effectiveness Considerations:**
   - The fusion approach, while slightly more accurate, may not justify the increased cost and complexity
   - For most commercial applications, selecting the appropriate single-sensor technology based on growth stage is recommended

4. **Practical Implementation:**
   - Regular surveys (every 42 days) provide sufficient temporal resolution to capture crop development
   - Integration with farm management systems can translate the remote sensing data into actionable insights

These findings help bridge the gap between research and practical application, enabling sugarcane farmers to make informed decisions about adopting UAV-based technologies for precision agriculture.
